# Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for Dimensionality Reduction and Visualization

This project demonstrates Principal Component Analysis (PCA) as a technique for reducing the dimensionality of datasets while preserving the most important variance. The project covers applying PCA on synthetic datasets and the MNIST handwritten digits dataset, showing how PCA helps in data visualization and efficient data representation.

## Project Overview

PCA is a widely used method in machine learning and data analysis to simplify data by projecting it onto fewer dimensions, making it easier to visualize and analyze. This project focuses on:

- Understanding PCA and its mathematical foundation  
- Applying PCA to synthetic 2D datasets  
- Visualizing data before and after PCA transformation  
- Analyzing explained variance to select optimal components  
- Applying PCA to the high-dimensional MNIST dataset for dimensionality reduction

## Features

- Clear explanation of PCA concept and steps  
- Data visualization pre- and post-PCA transformation  
- Explained variance and cumulative variance plotting  
- Dimensionality reduction on large-scale image dataset (MNIST)  
- Guidance on selecting the number of principal components to retain desired variance

## Tools Used

- Python 3.x  
- NumPy for numerical operations  
- Matplotlib for plotting and visualization  
- scikit-learn for PCA implementation  
- Keras (TensorFlow backend) to load MNIST dataset

## How to Run

Load your PCA implementation code in your favorite IDE or Jupyter/Colab notebook.

Run the code to see:

- Scatter plots of original and PCA-transformed data  
- Explained variance plots for dimensionality insights  
- Reduced dimensionality representation of MNIST data  
- Experiment with the number of principal components and observe effects on variance and data compression.
